# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model for predicting house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. The project is part of the Machine Learning internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Description
The task involves:
- Analyzing a dataset containing house information.
- Implementing a linear regression algorithm to predict house prices.
- Exploring relationships between square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and prices.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Files
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code implementation.
- `dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Timeline
- Start: 1st November, 23
- End: 30th November, 23
- Submission: 5th December, 23
